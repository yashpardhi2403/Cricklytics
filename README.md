## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Dashboards:** Utilizes Power BI to present dynamic and responsive visualizations. 📊
- **Automated Web Scraping:** Extracts real-time or periodically updated data from targeted websites. 🌐
- **Data Transformation:** Cleanses, transforms, and aggregates raw data to make it analysis-ready. 🔄
- **Modular Architecture:** Easily extend or modify the scraping and transformation processes as needed. 🛠️
- **Custom Reporting:** Offers tailored insights based on user-defined criteria and filters. 📈

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Power BI:** For creating and hosting interactive dashboards.
- **Python (or other scripting language):** For web scraping and data transformation tasks.
- **Pandas / DataFrame libraries:** To handle and transform datasets.
- **BeautifulSoup / Selenium:** (or other web scraping tools) to extract data from web sources.
- **REST APIs:** Where applicable, to fetch data in a structured format.
- **SQL / NoSQL databases:** For data storage and retrieval (if applicable).

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Power BI Desktop:** [Download and install](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/) 💻
- **Python 3.x:** Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4` or `selenium`
  - Additional libraries as specified in `requirements.txt`

### Installation Steps

  ## Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datadashboardproject.git
   cd datadashboardproject
  ```

## Setup Python Environment

### Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configure Data Sources
Update the configuration file (`config.json` or similar) with your target URLs and API keys if needed.

## Run Data Scraping and Transformation Scripts
```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

## Open Power BI Dashboard
- Open the provided Power BI file (`Dashboard.pbix`) in Power BI Desktop.
- Connect to the transformed data source (e.g., CSV file, database) if required.
- Refresh the dataset to load the latest data.

## 🎯 Usage

### Data Collection
- Execute the scraping script to pull data from the predefined websites. 🌐
- Verify the downloaded data in the `data/raw` directory.

### Data Transformation
- The transformation script cleans and aggregates the data.
- Processed data is saved in the `data/processed` directory. 🔄

### Dashboard Interaction
- Use Power BI to interact with the dashboard.
- Apply filters, drill down into metrics, and generate reports as needed. 📊

## 🌐 Data Sources
- List the primary websites or APIs used for scraping.
- Mention any restrictions or limitations related to the data (e.g., scraping frequency, legal considerations).

## 🔄 Data Transformation Pipeline
- **Extraction:** Data is scraped from multiple sources using designated tools and libraries.
- **Transformation:** Data is cleaned, normalized, and enriched to ensure consistency.
- **Loading:** The transformed data is exported in formats suitable for Power BI (e.g., CSV, SQL database).

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- **Real-Time Data Updates:** Implement a scheduler to automate the scraping and dashboard refresh. ⏱️
- **Advanced Analytics:** Incorporate machine learning models for predictive analytics. 🤖
- **Enhanced Visualization:** Expand the dashboard with additional KPIs and interactive elements. 📊
- **User Authentication:** Secure access to the dashboard for different user roles. 🔒
